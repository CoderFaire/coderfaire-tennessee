      In 2015, CoderFaire needed a break. Some of the founders and organizers, Cal and Kathy, had major life changes that moved them out of Tennessee and I just needed a year off to regroup. So Coderfaire took its break. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Early in 2016 I felt it was time to come back. I love this conference; the community it brings together along with the broad range of topics and subject matters has always peaked my personal interests. I felt it always brought out the best in Nashville. I wanted to have that experience again, so I worked on getting another small group together to begin the planning work. I want to thank Bill Israel, Jason Myers and Jason Orendorff for their organizing support. I want to especially thank Ben Ramsey for being the driving force in getting us all moving towards our common goal.
      </p>

      <p>
      We moved a little too slowly and got started a little too late. Because of this, we lost precious time and had to make a number of compromises on the structure of the event. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Still, we wanted to give CoderFaire 2016 a fighting chance so we decided we would assess possibilities once the call for proposals closed. They closed this past weekend. The result of our assessment? With great sadness, I’m here to let you all know that there will not be a CoderFaire 2016. To Ben who worked so hard, I’m sorry. 
      </p>

      <p>
      You’re probably curious as to why, and because of the timing with the call for proposals closing, would be quick to blame it on low submissions. Let me set on the record it was not the results of the call for proposals. Every time we open a CFP we see some of the greatest talk abstracts we’ve ever seen; even from going to other conferences. The Nashville community is as bright, educated and passionate, as any community I’ve seen. You all make me, and the rest of the organizers, proud to call Nashville home. 
      </p>

      <p>
      The biggest deciding factor for why we are not going through with this year’s event is a lack of funding. 
      </p>

      <p>
      You see over the past 5 years, Nashville has grown from one technology-focused event to over six, if you’re not counting the user groups. That’s almost two a quarter. If you count the users groups there are 40+ events every month and over a thousand people participating. All this is great news, but sadly this means at times, there’s not enough funds to go around. Our pool of relationships just didn’t come through for us this year. No hard feelings, just a fact.
      </p>

      <p>
      To put on a conference of our size, even with some cut backs, costs around $20,000. To put that financial burden on the attendees would have priced us out of a reasonable range.  
      </p>

      <p>
          For people who submitted to talk at CoderFaire, let me first say thank you. It’s because of you that I am even a part of this community. I learn so much from each one of you. Let me also point out that now you have a talk idea, a title, an abstract and have even sucked up any insecurities and submitted it to a conference. Do that again. Here are a few great local conferences that have open CFPs either open or coming up.

      <p>
      For those of you that were excited to attend CoderFaire, these same conferences, plus these additional ones are great and full of everything I love about the Nashville tech scene. If you’re curious where I’ll be, I’ll probably be at them all, but I am also hoping to bring back my drunk tech rants to Barcamp. I challenge you to pick a tech concept, anything from NSA spying to the vertical farming and inspire your peers there.

      As for 2017, we will be back early, I MEAN EARLY, next year to figure out what are the chances of CoderFaire Tennessee 2017.

      Thank you all for your continued support.
